# gptel-cpp-complete

`gptel-cpp-complete` is an experimental package that provides
**Copilot-style, context-aware C++ code completion** using:

- **eglot + clangd** for authoritative semantic information
- **ag (the_silver_searcher)** for repository-wide pattern retrieval
- **gptel** for LLM-powered code continuation
- **inline ghost text overlays** for a VS Code–like UX

Unlike generic AI assistants, this package is designed to behave like a
**language-server–style completion engine**, not a chat bot.
Its sole purpose is **accurate, minimal, inline code continuation**.

## Features

- Context-aware C++ code completion inside functions
- Uses *real* in-scope symbols from `clangd` (via LSP completion)
- Retrieves similar usage patterns from your repository with `ag`
- Strict system prompt to avoid hallucinated APIs
- Inline “ghost text” suggestions
- Regenerates completion as you type (except when accepting with RET)
- Fully local-LLM friendly (no cloud dependency required)
